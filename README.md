### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate software developer with a focus on building robust and user-friendly applications. I am proficient in various programming languages and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I am always eager to learn new things and explore new technologies.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, hiking, and experimenting with new recipes.

I am currently working on a personal project to develop a web application that helps users track their fitness goals.
